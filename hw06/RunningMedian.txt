RunningMedian is a class that keeps track of a list of elements, preserving odd/even.
It then can produce at any time a wide median of those elements. The size of this median is arbitrary.

This class is templated to any class that implements Comparable.

The constructor RunningMedian(T ...) takes in a variable number of parameters.
These parameters comprise the initial median, and the number of parameters is the size of every running median returned by this object.

  Store the size of the passed array as the size of the running median
  Create a SortedArrayList (specified separately in SortedArrayList.txt), and add the elements to it


Method median() gives an array containing the running wide median of the list.

  Get the size of the SortedArrayList

  The wide median is a sub-list centered around the median of the list
    To be more precise, it is defined as the sub-list of size medianWidth starting at (listSize / 2 - medianWidth / 2)

  Retrieve and return this sub-list from the SortedArrayList


Method add(T, T) adds two elements to the list, thus preserving odd/even.
It then also gives the current running median.

  Add both elements to the SortedArrayList in bulk
  Return the wide median of the list
